# #fCC1000 - 1,000 Hours of freeCodeCamp Challenge
## Are you ready to *grind* and learn to code for free? Take up the #fCC1000 Challenge. 

Learning to code is ***not*** a fucking walk in the park.  

It's looong winding road with a fuck-load of obstacles. It takes time. It requires effort. It is a commitment. 

### Do you want to 'learn to code' to get *\*that-cushy-dev-job\**?

Here's the thing. If you are *trying* to learn to code and you are not able to commit yourself to the process of learning - odds are that you aren't seeing the results that you want for the efforts that you are putting in. I've got news for you. You're doing it wrong, mate. 

It is easy to look at developers/programmers who have a nice job and seem to have their shit sorted. You see that *rich-guy-nice-car-kinda-software-guy* that's doing good for himself. You want to be like *that*. And, you think to yourself, 'I want to be like him someday, you know. Decent job. Good benefits. Great money. That's the fucking life, man!'.

But, here's the thing. You'll never be *that* guy, until you put in your sweat and tears to *learning the fucking craft*. You'll never be *that* guy, until your skill-set is decent enough for you to *get hired into a developer role*. **You'll never be *that* guy, if are not _grinding it today for a brighter tomorrow_**. 

#### *So, what do I mean by 'grinding'?*   
It's simple. I mean 'Giving up the NOW, for a **better** LATER'. That's all it is!

You want to play something on your pc/console/phone? You don't do it. Instead, you read a blog post on Javascript. You want to go out for a night with the boys? You don't do it. Instead, you sit your ass down and code that fucking project you've 'not-been-able-to-find-time-for'.  

You do something. You get rid of you game systems. You save a dollar. You pay off all your credit card debt. You don't get that new car you want. You are *now **grinding***.

Grinding is taking care of NOW, and building a FUTURE so that you can enjoy it. Things don't just happen by themselves. *You* are the one to make it happen and you need to do your time and put in the sincere and deliberate effort. And, that's the fucking thing you need to understand. 

Now that you're grinding, you are one step closer to being *that* guy!

You learn - you grow - you mature. You gotta pull the trigger on something. Sometimes you shoot yoursef in the foot and that's okay as long as you are learning. And, sometimes you hit the fucking bulls eye. Life is all about hits and misses. You win some and lose some. All you can do is challenge yourself and give it your best. 

## What is the '#fCC1000 Challenge' all about?

The #fCC1000 Challenge is about grinding to push yourself towards becoming *that* guy. Sure, it is about learning to code - that's a byproduct of this grind. But, more importantly, it is about committing yourself to *grinding towards your goals and aspirations* of living a better life.  

### Rules
1. Put in 1,000 Hours of deliberate effort to learn to code in one calendar year from date of start
2. Log everything on GitHub \(with a time-sheet if possible\)
3. Stay true to yourself
4. Remember - this is about you, your goals, your dreams and your aspirations. 
5. Remember - this is not about showing the world what you are doing. Their acknowledgement is momentary and fleeting! 

### How to participate?
- Create a GitHub repository with the url - \*your-username\*\fCC1000

### Not rules
1. freeCodeCamp is a great place to start to learn to code. If you want to move on to different things, you are welcome to do so. But I insist that you spend as much time on freeCodeCamp as you can to learn the basics.  
2. You don't need to do the whole 'I'll code everyday' thing. This is not a #1000DaysOfCode Challenge. Learn whenever you can but you need to complete your 1000 Hours in one calendar year. 
3. You don't need to post anything on social media if you don't want to. You are welcome to do so if you think social pressure works for you. Remember rule 4 and 5. Your results are the only things that matter. 

## For the uninitiated, what is 'freeCodeCamp'?
[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a tiny non-profit that's helping millions of people learn to code for free. Their mission is 'to help people learn to code for free'. They accomplish this by creating thousands of videos, articles, and interactive coding lessons - all freely available to the public.

Here is my 2 cent contribution to the freeCodeCamp resources to help others learn to code. With #fcc1000, I aim to solve freeCodeCamp challenges for **over 1,000 Hours** and provide video solutions for the same.  

### How to find the freeCodeCampChallenge solutions?

You can search using the following format - *\'Challenge Title\' + \'solution fCC1000\'*.  

For esample, if the title of the challenge is '*Say Hello to HTML Elements*', you need to search for '*Say Hello to HTML Elements solution fCC1000*'.
